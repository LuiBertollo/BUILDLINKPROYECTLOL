    "S1_StartsToMoveAround": "It seems that you are hungry. Let’s try to get some food.",

    "S2_ReproduceWindow_0": "Now it’s time to reproduce yourself. Some mutations may occur in the process and your offspring may keep them. This process takes place as part of a random mutation process, but today we can play with it a little.",
    "S2_ReproduceWindow_1": "Let’s choose some structural adaptations for our lifeform. We need to move a little faster, don’t you think?",
    "S2_StartsToMoveAround": "Oh! Some mutations make a big improvement in the populations. Moving faster gives the offspring more chances of surviving.",
    "S2_MoveAroundAgain": "There’s a lot of food… but not enough for everyone. Hurry up!",
    "S3_ReproduceWindow_0": "Now you have to choose. Maybe you want your life forms to be acid resistant or capable of synthesizing new forms of nutrients.",
    "S3_ReproduceWindow_1": "Remember: new mutations may be part of the offspring's heir.",
    "S3_UnadaptedOffpring": "The offspring that do not adapt their defenses can’t survive to the new challenges of the environment.",
    "S3_EatsNewNutrients": "Now you are able to synthesize new nutrients. It means you can evolve faster than your previous heritage.",
    "S3_EnemyOnScreen": "Some hostile lifeforms also explore around this place, looking for food. Be careful. Move fast or find a place to hide: you don’t want to be in their way.",
    "S4_ReproduceWindow_0": "Now it’s time to add the other adaptation to the list of your traits. At least, every advantage is important when you need to survive.",
    "S5_ReproduceWindow_0": "The behavior of your population is a form of adaptation too. Maybe you can confront some hostile entities out there with the correct choice.",
    "EOG_Congratulations": "Congratulations! Your population got adapted to the environment through generations and survived effectively. This process doesn’t have an end… the evolution continues as long as the population survives.",
    "FoodIstaken": "There is not enough food for you to fill your DNA bar… let’s try again.",
    "TryToPassAcid": "Acid dissolves your cells… maybe you should need more protection before trying going there again.",

    "CollisionWithEnemy": "Hostile lifeforms are a treat to your population survival. Be careful next time. Choose your adaptations wise.",
    "EnemyCanBeDeactivated": "Entities which are smaller than you, or even the same size, can be confronted. You can try getting closer and see!",
    "BiggerHostileEnemyTouchsPlayer": "It’s true you can defend yourself now… but be realistic!"
